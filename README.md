Version Draft V.0.2 - Feb 2018






Challenge:

 As the demand for higher education increases, the cost of College attendance along with its complementary programs is increasing at an exponential rate. Consequently, the gap of opportunity inequality is widening for people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Having to focus on educational goals and finding a balance between academic life and other responsibilities, students from various backgrounds will lack sufficient incentives to prosper both as a student and as a member of the community.  




Our Solution:

The objective of CSM Coin is to stabilize the opportunity cost for people from various backgrounds who seek to continue their higher education. Since GPA is an important factor in a student’s ability to transfer to college, CSM coin is used as an incentive to propel students beyond their limits. Consequently, by taking into account various parameters, our team has derived a normalized GPA scale system which will be used to reward students. 


Definations:
The Cumulative GPA (GPACumulative): It includes the total acquired GPA which is calculated based on both major-specific courses and General Education (GE) courses.
The Current GPA in a specific semester/quarter (GPACC): It is the GPA based per semester/quarter.
The Units Completed (UC): The total units completed by each student so far.
The total units required for transfer to a four-year institution (UR)
The units completed per semester (US)
The average major-based GPA at a specific school (GPA M/S): This value varies for each institution and is dependent on the major of every student. This sub-metric is crucial in eliminating in potential source of biased when calculating the normalized GPA (which will be used to reward students via CSM coin).
  The maximum possible GPA value that can be attained by a student: 4.0
The Proportionality Constant (K)



The Equations Being Used:

Equation 1: GPACumulative defined: The GPACumulative is calculated by taking the sum of the units taken by an individual multiplied by the grades received for each class, and dividing the value of the total units taken.



Equation 2: Normalized GPA (GPAN) defined:

Consequently, the GPA factor can be normalized by the current semester (or quarter) GPA and 
cumulative GPA through the all semesters. The model graph for the proposed mathematical formulas written above is the following: See Appendix I.





 The graphs of original and modified normal distribution (Appendix I)

Appendix I : 
The Orange Curve:
It represents the original population distribution based on cumulative GPA.
The height of the graph represents the student population, and the horizontal direction represents the GPA scale.
The White Curve (dotted lines):
It represents the normalized GPA function that is derived above (page 3).
It shares the same axis as the Orange Curve.
The Color Scale (On the right side of the graph):
It represents the GPA scale for every individual student:
Yellow = 4.0 GPA
Purple = 0.0 GPA
Analysis: 
The original normal distribution (standard deviation = 1, Average GPA = 2.0) is shift (shrunk) in the modified GPAN curve 
In the modified distribution curve, the average GPA is 0.6. 


The Microscale of the GPANormalized Graph (Appendix II) :



Appendix II : This graph shows a more detailed distribution of the GPA in both the Orange and White curves seen above. The number of distribution of the modified graph is influenced by the number of units taken by each student. As seen in the original curve, even if a student maintains a 4.0 GPA, he will be shifted down the curve as the number of units taken decreases.




The absolute increase of the normalized GPA (GPAN) Vs. the standard count (Appendix III)


Appendix III : 
This graph represents the original GPA per student (in different colors).
The vertical axis represents the normalized GPA, and the horizontal axis represents the standard scale. 
Analysis:
If the GPA is below average, the rate of the increase of the normalized GPA is almost the same for every student. 
If the GPA is above average, the rate of increase of the normalized GPA is not the same ⇒ The higher a student’s cumulative GPA, the higher the rate of increase. See image below.

 This image shows a portion of the graph in Appendix III. As described above, the correlation 
between GPA and the rate of increase is depicted.  


The Normal CurveM/S vs. population density graph (Appendix IV)
         
        
Appendix IV :
The graphs shows the normal curve within different school/major average. Starting from the first graph, the GPA decreases by an increment of 0.5 such that: (linspace(4,-0.5,0)).
The yellow/blue redistribution represents the adjustment of grade dissemination according to every student’s original GPA. 
Analysis:
Along with the average GPA getting lower, the yellow region becomes bipolar the green region becomes divergent. That means the even though the average GPA before the normalization may be high, the most of population will being “dragged” to the lower region. 
The normalized average GPA is much staible that the GPA without normalized. The divergence of Unnormalized GPA is 4.0 whereas the Normalized GPA is below 1.0. 
For instance, the Average GPA equals 2 with the sandard diviation equals 1. 
the curve fitting function G3 is the third Gaussian Plot (See table below):

Given an initial trading amount with a certain trading rate, the improvement of trading is given the curve above. The k is promote factor, which represents the desire of trading. The smaller k is, the bigger trading potentials are.

Appendix VII : 
Given a different set of initial trading amount with a certain trading rate, the curve is indicated. The white arrow represents the significant of promote factor of k. No matter how high initial transaction is, the k dominates the tendency of trading. The first intersection represents the biggest transition amount and so on.

Appendix VI :
this graph represents the different initial transaction rate respects the same initial transaction amount. You can see clearly that how effective that initial transaction rate is.

Appendix VI :
this graph represents the different initial transaction rate that motified the stability by using factor R. 





Appendix VI :
this graph represents the alternative way of representing the stability Through a conjugation symmetry, the reputation frequency stage can be restored as elliptical areas (with the major axis). Thus, we define the stability of a closed crypto market by its elliptical areas that are disclosed by a certain promote factor k and stability factor R.


Token Distribution:

To ensure equal opportunity and fairness for all, we have proposed a free market for CSM token. There will be a fixed cap of total number of tokens, built within the POA network. The choice of this network was based on a number of desirable characteristics. One such characteristic is our need for future scaling solutions, such as horizontal Blockchains.  The team can foresee a future in which a separate, dedicated, Blockchain of educational professionals acting as a validating set becomes needed, and POA Network has such a future potential.  

Since we envision this token acting as a unit of accounting, we will have large number of transactions within our system.  Token holders will expect their transactions to be processed in a timely manner, and we need guaranteed block times.  POA Network’s Proof-of-Authority consensus mechanism allows for block times of around 5 seconds.  Although this is not real time finality, something that purely financial applications may require, for our intended use case will be more than sufficient.  A five second block time will allow for participants to interact within our system with an acceptable waiting period. 

Lastly, costs of interacting within our system’s base platform must be kept as low as possible.  The team’s vision is one of XXX

The goal of the token is to act as an internal unit of accounting, that permits one to access various cost centers typically associated with a student’s pursuit of a degree at their institute of higher education.  In order that these tokens are used for this intended goal and to minimize undue speculation, a large base supply of tokens will be initially created in the amount of YYY billion.  Furthermore, a nominal inflation rate of YYY percent will be applied to combat the loss of tokens during normal use. XXX  

In the first phase of distribution, ~25% of the tokens will be accessible to the market and dispersed among the student community accordingly. The remainder of the tokens will be pumped into the market at a steady rate to ensure that the token does not lose its true value.
